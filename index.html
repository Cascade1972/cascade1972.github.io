                   Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Chandlor Stauff, a proud graduate of Boise State University with a degree from the GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile) program. 
                    This site is a place where you can get to know me and explore the projects I've created during my time in GIMM. I'm passionate about continuous growth and always looking for opportunities to expand my skills and strengthen my portfolio.
                    <br>
                    The GIMM program, or Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile, is a program at Boise State which gives students the knowledge to use and manage modern technology
                    for everyday uses. My experience since being in the GIMM program has been phenomenal. I have learned so much and I continue to learn new skills that I didn't know before.
                    <br>

                    The first project I ever did during my time in the GIMM program was creating an individual 2D game. This was a great experience to go through becuase
                    it was the first time I was introduced to game development and programming. The game is called Radical Rex: The Helmet Evader; the skateboard finactic 
                    Rex loves skateboarding but does not want to wear a helmet. The goal of the game is to skate around and collect coins while avoiding the enemy helmets.
                    When you collect a certain amount of coins, you move onto the next level. Some fun features I added to the game was when you collect an 'x' amount
                    of coins you get a speed boost and jump boost. It's a very basic game but I'm proud of how it turned out being my first ever project.

                    Task Master is a prototype of an app created to assist special needs children with breaking down simple tasks. The prototype focused on the task of brushing teeth, 
                    using Apple's built in sound analysis software to detect if certain steps of the process were being completed, 
                    such as turning a faucet on or off, 
                    or actually brushing one's teeth.

                    During my second year in the GIMM Program we made a project using an Arduino computing board with the topic of creating something to help real world
                    issues. The purpose of my project is to make a security alarm system that senses when your precious valuables are in trouble. 
                    When the alarm is triggered, lights light up, an alarm noise is played, and a laser is pointed at the perpetrator. This was a fun project to make becuase it was all hands on and it was something new to create.
                    We had to create a box that fit our project in and were introduced to soldering and that was a necessity for the final product. I was overall happy with the final product.
